<p>I love all aspects of software engineering, but to me, the best part is creating new things from nothing. There’s nothing that fascinates me more than working with a team to create incredible products and challenge myself daily to learn new things and find creative solutions. With deep experience in both tech and entrepreneurship, I specialize in plan execution and problem- solving.</p>
