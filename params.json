{"name":"Morgan Steffy","tagline":"Portfolio Site","body":"![Morgan's Picture](http://www.trypickle.com/images/team/morgan.png)\r\n\r\n# Morgan Steffy\r\n## Software Developer\r\nI love all aspects of software engineering, but to me, the best part is creating new things from nothing. There’s nothing that fascinates me more than working with a team to create incredible products and challenge myself daily to learn new things and find creative solutions. With deep experience in both tech and entrepreneurship, I specialize in plan execution and problem- solving. As a woman in tech, I’m also passionate about inspiring a new generation of female engineers.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Pickle\r\nPickle is a startup I co-founded and where I worked as CTO. I wrote the iOS app in Objective-C and utilized Parse, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and various cocoa pods. Visit the [site](http://www.trypickle.com) or the [itunes store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pickle-competitive-selfies/id907951626?mt=8) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Storii\r\nStorii is an app I built with a team that is similar to Instagram, but allows you to post video and image compilations similar to Snapchat. Written in Swift, the biggest challenges with this project were image and video compression and streaming. It also includes accessing the address book and texting friends invitations to download the app.\r\n\r\n### CreepShot\r\nBuilt entirely for fun one weekend, this app is a game you play with friends to take pictures of each other when the other person isn't looking. It includes a custom built camera and accessing the phone's address book. Written in Objective-C.\r\n\r\n### TrackWired\r\nThis Angular app layered with Ionic framework deploys onto both Android and iOS devices natively. It is used by athletes and coaches to co-ordinate schedules and keep track of workouts.

It allows members of a hunting club to log into a portal to accept the location they were assigned for the next day, or select from the remaining avalible locations where they would like to hunt instead. Utilizes CRON jobs and other server-size code.\r\n\r\n### University Claims Management Systems\r\nThis Rails app allows student to login and create a claim if they are injured on campus and allows an administrator to accept or deny each claim.\r\n\r\n### Ultimate Musician’s League\r\nI built this Angular webapp so schools could provide a fun way for their students to compete against one another during their musical performances. It utilizes transactional emails, responsive web design, and includes real-time data updates with the fire-base backend.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
